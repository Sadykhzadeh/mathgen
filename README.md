## About The Project

Generating various mathematical expressions with answer options independently, for example, for primary school teachers ‚Äî is a routine job. 

This library will help automate this process; it is enough to write the required arguments like expression's length, optionally brackets and other cool features.

## Built With

- [üíôTypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/)

## Getting Started

So, you need to install Node.JS and generate Node.JS project in order to use SaMathGen library

### Prerequisites

There are several ways of installing **NodeJS**:

 - [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) - one of the easiest way
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
# restart terminal (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#troubleshooting-on-linux)
nvm install --lts
```
 - via [NodeSource Node.js Binary Distributions](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md) by a package manager
 - Downloading ```tar.xz``` from [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/) 

### Installation

1. Create new Node.JS project

```sh
# works only in macOS & Linux, for Windows just create new folder and open it in cmd
mkdir new_project && cd new_project
```

2. After Installing Node.JS, initialize your Node.JS project and install SaMathGen

```sh
npm init -y && npm i samathgen
```
3. That's it! :D

## Usage

1. Create index.js(or .ts) and type this example: 

```js
const { mathGen } = require("samathgen");
console.log(mathGen(3, {
  "answer": 20,
  "brackets": false,
  "quizOptions": true
}));
```

2. Type ```node index.js``` (or .ts) in console and that's it! ü•≥

```js
> node index.js                                                                                                                                    
{
  task: [ 40, '/', 4, '+', 10 ],
  answer: 2,
  quizOptions: [ 14, 17, 20, 15 ]
}
```
